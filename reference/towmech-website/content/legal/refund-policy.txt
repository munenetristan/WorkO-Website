This Refund & Cancellation Policy explains how cancellations and refunds work on TowMech for both Customers and Service Providers (“Providers”).

By using TowMech, you agree to the rules below.


1. Definitions

Booking Fee: The fee charged to confirm a job request on TowMech.
Job Assigned: When a Provider has accepted and is officially allocated to a Customer job.
Refund: A return of paid funds back to the Customer where applicable.
No Refund: A situation where a cancellation is permitted but the booking fee is not returned.


2. Customer Cancellations

Customers may cancel a job at any time. However, whether the booking fee is refunded depends on the timing and job status.

2.1 Cancellation Within 3 Minutes After Assignment
If the Customer cancels within 3 minutes after the job is assigned, then:
✅ The Customer may qualify for a refund of the booking fee.

2.2 Cancellation After 3 Minutes of Assignment
If the Customer cancels after 3 minutes, then:
❌ The booking fee is not refunded, unless otherwise required by law or approved by TowMech.

2.3 Provider Delay (45 Minutes Rule)
If the Provider has not arrived within 45 minutes after assignment, then:
✅ The Customer may cancel and qualify for a refund of the booking fee, subject to verification.


3. Provider Cancellations

Providers must not accept jobs they cannot complete.

If a Provider cancels a job after accepting/being assigned, TowMech may:
- Restrict Provider access
- Reduce visibility/priority
- Apply penalties
- Suspend or terminate the Provider account
- Mark the Provider as unreliable in internal safety logs

TowMech reserves the right to take any action necessary to protect Customers and platform integrity.


4. Refund Processing

Refunds (where applicable) are processed based on the payment provider’s timelines and internal verification checks.

Refund processing may require:
- Job review
- Status verification
- Evidence review
- Confirmation of payment status

TowMech does not guarantee instant refunds.


5. Fraud & Abuse

TowMech may deny refunds or reverse refund eligibility where there is:
- Fraud
- Abuse of the cancellation system
- False reporting
- Suspicious or repeated cancellation behavior

TowMech’s decision is final unless legally required otherwise.
